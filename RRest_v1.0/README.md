# Respiratory Rate Estimation Algorithms: v.1

This version of the toolbox contains the algorithms used in the following publication:

Charlton P.H. *et al.* [**Waveform analysis to estimate respiratory rate**](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/waveform_analysis.html), in *Secondary analysis of Electronic Health Record Data*, Springer, [Under Review]

The work presented in this publication can be replicated exactly by following the instructions [here](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/waveform_analysis.html).

## User Manual

The accompanying [Wiki](https://github.com/peterhcharlton/RRest/wiki) acts as a user manual for the algorithms presented in this repository.

## Further Resources

For those interested in estimating respiratory rate from physiological signals, the wider [Respiratory Rate Estimation project](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/), of which this is a part, will be of interest. It also contains additional material such as data to use with the algorithms, publications arising from the project, and details of how to contribute.
