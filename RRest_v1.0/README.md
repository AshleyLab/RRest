# Respiratory Rate Estimation Algorithms: v.1

This version of the toolbox contains the algorithms used in the following publication:

Charlton P.H. *et al.* [**Waveform analysis to estimate respiratory rate**](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/waveform_analysis.html), in *Secondary analysis of Electronic Health Record Data*, Springer, [Under Review]

The work presented in this publication can be replicated exactly by following the instructions [here](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/waveform_analysis.html).

## Summary

Several techniques have been developed for estimation of respiratory rate (RR) from physiological waveforms.
This case study presents a comparison of exemplary techniques for estimation of RR from the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveforms.
Both the database and code used to evaluate the techniques are publicly available, equipping the reader with tools to develop and test their own RR algorithms for estimation of RR from physiological waveforms.

## Further Resources

The accompanying [Wiki](https://github.com/peterhcharlton/RRest/wiki) acts as a user manual for the algorithms presented in this repository.

For those interested in estimating respiratory rate from physiological signals, the wider [Respiratory Rate Estimation project](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/), of which this is a part, will be of interest. It also contains additional material such as data to use with the algorithms, publications arising from the project, and details of how to contribute.
