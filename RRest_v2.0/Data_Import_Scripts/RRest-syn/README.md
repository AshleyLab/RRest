The _RRest-sim_ Dataset
=============================

Simulated electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram signals modulated by respiration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Overview

The _RRest-sim_ dataset consists of simulated electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals which have been modulated by one of the three respiratory modulations:

* Baseline Wander (BW),
* Amplitude Modulation (AM), or
* Frequency Modulation (FM)

It is designed for assessment of respiratory rate (RR) algorithms as first described in the article cited below. It allows one to firstly test whether an RR algorithm has been implemented _reasonably_ (_i.e._ whether it estimates RR accurately in ideal conditions). Secondly, one can identify the limitations of RR algorithms, such as whether they perform accurately in the presence of one particular modulation, and whether their performance is linked to the underlying heart rate (HR) or respiratory rate (RR).

### Example

The following figure shows exemplary Synthetic Signals. Idealised PPG and ECG signals are shown on the top row. On the three subsequent rows are idealised signals modulated with BW, AM and FM.

### Methods

The dataset was generated using the Matlab &reg; script called _RRest-syn_generator_. Exemplary ECG and PPG beats lasting one second were repeated 210 times, giving a simulated signal lasting 210 s. This signal was then modulated by each of the three respiratory modulations in turn (BW, AM and FM), producing three separate signals. This process was repeated for a range of HRs (30 - 200 beats per minute) and RRs (4 - 60 breaths per minute). When the HR was varied, the RR was fixed at 20 bpm. When the RR was varied, the HR was fixed at 80 bpm.

For further details of the methodology please see the article cited below.

### Format

The dataset is provided in three formats:

* Comma-separated value (.csv) format,
* Matlab &reg; data format (.mat), and
* WaveForm DataBase (WFDB) format.

In addition, the script used to generate the data, _RRest-syn_generator_, is provided in Matlab &reg; format (although this can be read as a text file).

### Files

The files are separated into three directories. The data is provided in three directories, one for each format. Within each directory are the files corresponding to each of the 192 generated signals (consisting of 35 signals with the RR fixed at 20 bpm, and 29 signals with the HR fixed at 80 bpm, each repeated three times - once for each respiratory modulation). These files are named as _RRest-sim###_, where ### varies from 1-192.
