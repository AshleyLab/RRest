The _RRest_ Synthetic Dataset
=============================

### Overview

The _RRest_ Synthetic Dataset consists of simulated ECG and PPG signals which have been modulated by one of the three respiratory modulations:

* Baseline Wander (BW),
* Amplitude Modulation (AM), or
* Frequency Modulation (FM)

It is designed for assessment of respiratory rate (RR) algorithms under ideal conditions.
