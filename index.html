<p>The aim of the "Respiratory Rate Estimation" project is to provide open-source resources to assist researchers with the development of algorithms for estimation of respiratory rate from commonly measured physiological signals. Firstly, source code is provided. Secondly, sample datasets consisting of physiological signals and reference respiratory signals are provided.</p>

<p>Respiratory rate is a widely used indicator of health, used by clinicians in conjunction with other parameters to assess the health of patients in hospitals, clinics, and the community. For instance, all acutely-ill hospital patients have their respiratory rate measured every few hours to facilitate early detection of clinical deteriorations (deteriorations in health). However, respiratory rate is usually measured manually, by counting the number of breaths a patient takes in a specific period of time, such as a minute. This can potentially be time-consuming and inaccurate.</p>

<p>An alternative solution could be provided by developing an automated, electronic method for measuring respiratory rate using a device. To this end a plethora of algorithms have been proposed to estimate respiratory rate from several physiological signals, such as the electrocardiogram, photoplethysmogram, accelerometry signal, impedance pneumography signal, and so on. These signals can be easily measured, and in some scenarios are already measured for other purposes. Consequently, a robust, practicable algorithm for estimating respiratory rate from these signals could potentially benefit patients and healthcare providers alike.</p>

<p>Research into respiratory rate algorithms has been hindered by a lack of open-source algorithms. As a result, the aim of this project is to provide open-source algorithms to facilitate future research. As stated in the licence accompanying the source code, the algorithms are not intended to be fit for any purpose. Instead, they act as an platform from which researchers can develop algorithms.</p>

<p>Further details of the algorithms are available <a href="algorithms.html">here</a>.</p>
