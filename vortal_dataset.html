<h3><a id="Summary" class="anchor" href="#datasets" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

<p>The Vortal dataset is a dataset of electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse oximetry (photoplethysmogram, PPG) signals acquired from healthy volunteers.
This dataset is intended to facilitate evaluation of the performance of algorithms under ideal operating conditions.
</p>

<h3><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Details</h3>

<p>The dataset contains ECG, PPG, Impedance Pneumography (IP) and reference oral-nasal pressure signals acquired from young subjects (aged 18-39) and elderly subjects (aged over 70). Data was acquired from all subjects for approximately 10 minutes while lying supine at rest. In addition, data was collected from young subjects during walking, running, and lying supine once again whilst recovering from exercise.
</p>

<h3><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Publication</h3>

<p>The dataset was first reported in <a href="yhvs_assessment.html">this publication</a>, which contains additional information on the dataset.
Only data from young subjects lying supine was used in this publication.
