# Respiratory Rate Estimation Algorithms

This repository contains algorithms for estimation of respiratory rate from the electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram.

## User Manual

The accompanying Wiki acts as a user manual for the algorithms presented in this repository.

## Further Resources

For those interested in estimating respiratory rate from physiological signals, the wider [Respiratory Rate Estimation project](http://peterhcharlton.github.io/RRest/), of which this is a part, will be of interest. It also contains additional material such as data to use with the algorithms, publications arising from the project, and details of how to contribute.
