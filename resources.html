<h3><a id="Respiratory rate presentations" class="anchor" href="#respiratory-rate-presentations" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Presentations</h3>

<p>The following presentations are available for download:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><a href="https://github.com/peterhcharlton/RRest/files/386204/20160511.Assessment.of.algorithms.pdf">
    An assessment of algorithms</a></b><br>
  An introduction to the RRest project, with a focus on the assessment of RR algorithms reported in <a href="yhvs_assessment.html">this publication</a>.
  This presentation is designed for use in Journal Club settings. Originally presented at the <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~davidc/meetings.php">University of Oxford</a>.
  <li><b><a href="https://github.com/peterhcharlton/RRest/files/386203/20160728.Data.Dialogue.pdf">
    The processes and benefits of sharing clinical data</a></b><br>
  This talk considers the sharing of clinical trial data, using the RRest project as a case study.
  The typical processes of acquiring, managing and sharing clinical data are explained.
  The benefits of sharing data and tools are also highlighted.
  Originally presented at a <a href="http://www.ses.ac.uk/event/data-dialogue-time-share-navigating-boundaries-benefits/">Science and Engineering South</a> event.
